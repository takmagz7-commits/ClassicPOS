## Executive Summary

This report details security vulnerabilities and issues discovered during comprehensive authentication testing of ClassicPOS. Multiple security concerns were identified that require immediate attention.

---

## Critical Vulnerabilities

*No CRITICAL severity issues found* ✅


---

## High Severity Issues

*No HIGH severity issues found* ✅


---

## Medium Severity Issues

*No MEDIUM severity issues found* ✅


---

## Low Severity Issues

### LOW-1: No Explicit CSRF Protection

**Description:** Application relies solely on SameSite=strict for CSRF protection

**Impact:** May be vulnerable in browsers that do not support SameSite

**Recommendation:**
```
Consider implementing additional CSRF token validation for critical operations
```

## Missing Security Features

### 1. Account Lockout Mechanism

**Impact:** Allows unlimited login attempts

**Recommendation:** Implement account lockout after 5 failed attempts

---

### 2. Session Revocation

**Impact:** Cannot invalidate compromised tokens immediately

**Recommendation:** Implement token blacklist or use short-lived tokens with refresh tokens

---

### 3. Two-Factor Authentication Enforcement

**Impact:** MFA is optional, not enforced for sensitive roles

**Recommendation:** Enforce MFA for Admin and Manager roles

---

### 4. Password Complexity Requirements

**Impact:** Only length requirement, no complexity check

**Recommendation:** Enforce uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character requirements

---

### 5. Audit Logging for Failed Attempts

**Impact:** No tracking of suspicious authentication patterns

**Recommendation:** Log all failed authentication attempts with IP and timestamp

---



---

## Recommended Code Fixes

### Fix 1: No Explicit CSRF Protection

**File:** `backend/routes/auth.cjs`

**Current Issue:**
Application relies solely on SameSite=strict for CSRF protection

**Recommended Fix:**
```javascript
Consider implementing additional CSRF token validation for critical operations
```

## Open Endpoints Analysis

### Public Endpoints

| Endpoint | Auth Required | Rate Limited | Status |
|----------|---------------|--------------|--------|
| /api/auth/signup | No ❌ | Yes ✅ | ✅ Properly protected |
| /api/auth/login | No ❌ | Yes ✅ | ✅ Properly protected |
| /api/auth/pin-login | No ❌ | No ❌ | ❌ Missing rate limiting |
| /api/auth/verify-mfa | No ❌ | Yes ✅ | ✅ Properly protected |
| /api/auth/logout | No ❌ | No ❌ | ⚠️ Could benefit from rate limiting |
| /api/auth/me | Yes ✅ | No ❌ | ✅ Requires authentication |
| /api/auth/verify-token | Yes ✅ | No ❌ | ✅ Requires authentication |
| /api/health | No ❌ | No ❌ | ✅ Public health check |
