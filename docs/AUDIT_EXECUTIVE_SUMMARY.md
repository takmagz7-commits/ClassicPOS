# Copy output to .env as JWT_SECRET

# 3. Configure workflow
# Name: Full Stack Server
# Command: npm run dev:all
# Port: 5000
# Type: webview

# 4. Test application
npm run dev:all
```

## Bottom Line

**ClassicPOS is an impressive, feature-rich POS system with solid architecture and 90%+ feature completion.** 

However, it has **5 critical blockers** that prevent production deployment:
1. Missing environment configuration
2. Critical MFA security vulnerability
3. No deployment setup
4. No testing infrastructure
5. Excessive debug logging

**Recommended Path Forward:**
1. **Immediately** (3-5 hours): Fix P0 critical issues
2. **This Week** (5 days): Security hardening and deployment setup
3. **This Month** (3 weeks): Add tests, monitoring, optimization

**Final Verdict:** With 2-3 days of focused work on critical issues, this application can be safely deployed to production for initial users. Full production-hardening will require 2-3 additional weeks.
