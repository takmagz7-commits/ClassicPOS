  - Automatic rotation with retention of last 14 backups
  - Manual backup API endpoint for admin users: `POST /api/backups/manual`
  - Backup listing endpoint: `GET /api/backups/list`
  - Database restore functionality: `POST /api/backups/restore/:filename`
  - Environment variables: `BACKUP_ENABLED`, `BACKUP_SCHEDULE`, `BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS`
  - Backups stored in `/backups/` directory (gitignored)

#### API Documentation

  - Security scheme documentation (cookie-based JWT auth)
  - Schema definitions for Product, Sale, Customer, PurchaseOrder models

#### Environment & Configuration
