**Priority:** HIGH
**Reason:** Cannot invalidate compromised tokens
**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours

---

### 3. 🟠 Add Account Lockout Mechanism

**Priority:** HIGH
**Reason:** Prevent brute force on user accounts
**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours

---

### 4. 🟡 Enhance Password Complexity Requirements

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Reason:** Strengthen password security
**Estimated Effort:** 1 hour

---

### 5. 🟡 Enforce MFA for Admin/Manager Roles

**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Reason:** Protect high-privilege accounts
**Estimated Effort:** 2 hours

---

### 6. 🟢 Add Explicit CSRF Protection

**Priority:** LOW
**Reason:** Defense in depth beyond SameSite
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours
