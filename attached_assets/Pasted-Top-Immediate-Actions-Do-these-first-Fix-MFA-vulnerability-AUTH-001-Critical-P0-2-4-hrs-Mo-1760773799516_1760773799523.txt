Top Immediate Actions (Do these first)

Fix MFA vulnerability (AUTH-001) — Critical, P0 — 2–4 hrs
Move TOTP verification to the server; never return mfaSecret to the client. I can generate the exact patch (server-side verification + tests) now.

Create .env & ensure workflow config exists — P0 — 5–10 min
Add .env (secure defaults) and .env.example and verify dev start scripts point to the right env vars.

Replace placeholder JWT_SECRET — P0 — 2–5 min
Generate secure secret and ensure it’s read from env, not committed.

Restart/workflow fix so dev server runs — P0 — 5–15 min
Ensure npm run dev (frontend/backend) has working env and scripts.

Short Plan (2–3 days) — get to Minimum Viable Production

Patch MFA and re-run auth flows (2–4 hrs)

Implement simple print/email receipt (8–24 hrs) — or disable printing button until ready

Add backend validation for GRN/PO status & implement stock reversal checks (6–10 hrs)

Remove console logs and add utils/logger (2–4 hrs)

Fix CategoryContext startup race (2–3 hrs)

Create .env, update docs, and CI workflow skeleton (1–2 hrs)

Estimated effort: ~16–24 hours total for MV production (matching your estimate)

Longer improvements (post-MV)

Add Jest tests and CI (40+ hrs to reach meaningful coverage)

Bundle optimizations / code splitting (4–6 hrs)

Accessibility & UX polish (10–16 hrs)

Production monitoring (Sentry), rate limiting, and hardened logging (6–10 hrs)

Ready-to-Run Options — pick one and I’ll produce the exact outputs now

Patch AUTH-001 now (recommended)

I will produce a ready-to-apply patch / code diff for backend/routes/auth.cjs that:
• removes mfaSecret exposure,
• verifies TOTP server-side with speakeasy,
• returns only sanitized user + token on success,
• adds a simple unit test for the MFA route.

I will also provide a short checklist to verify the patch locally.

Generate Fix Pack 2.0 script

A single Node script (e.g. classicpos-fixpack2.js) which applies the set of high-priority code changes (MFA fix, .env, logging replacement, category context guard, disable print/email buttons), creates backups, and produces an audit diff. (You’ll run it locally.)

Create .env + workflow fixes

I’ll provide a secure .env.example, instructions to create .env, and updated package.json dev scripts and README snippet so npm run dev works for both frontend and backend.

Produce a prioritized task list (Jira/Trello CSV)

I’ll export a full task list (titles, descriptions, estimates, severity) you can import into your project tracker.

Do everything: full Fix Pack (apply all P0 + P1 + P2 listed)

I’ll produce detailed patches for every item in your Comprehensive Audit (this is the largest option — I’ll produce code changes/patch files and a rollout plan).
