ClassicPOS Audit Prompt (No Code Changes, DB-Agnostic)

Task:

You are an AI software engineer reviewing the ClassicPOS project. Your task is to scan the entire codebase — frontend, backend, and configuration files — and produce a detailed report of missing, incomplete, or broken parts. Do not modify any code yet.

🔍 Objectives

Generate a comprehensive audit report identifying:

Unfinished or placeholder features

Missing business logic

Broken links or dependencies

Integration gaps

Environment or configuration issues

UI/UX inconsistencies

Focus on all modules, regardless of the database implementation (the database may be localStorage, IndexedDB, cloud, or any backend DB).

🧩 Scope of Scan

Include but not limited to:

Frontend: src/ (components, modules, pages, hooks, utils)

Backend: api/, server/, routes/, controllers/, services/

Configuration: package.json, vite.config.ts, tsconfig.json, .env.example

Data Models: Any database schemas, models, or context-based storage

UI & Routing: Pages, navigation, responsive views

🧾 Report Should Include

1. Unfinished or Placeholder Features

Incomplete or stubbed modules, components, or pages

TODO, FIXME, console.log() placeholders

2. Broken Links or Dependencies

Missing imports or unused variables

Broken routes, missing components, or undefined functions

3. Incomplete Business Logic

Inventory workflows (PO → GRN → SA → TOG, valuation, reports)

Checkout & payments (multi-payment, barcode, open orders)

CRM (customer data, leads, analytics)

Accounting (credit notes, debtors, reconciliation)

Settings, billing, subscriptions, receipt configuration

4. Integration Gaps

Missing API endpoints or incomplete data flow

Offline DB sync not connected

Authentication/session logic incomplete

5. Environment & Configuration Issues

Missing .env variables or misconfigured settings

Missing or outdated dependencies in package.json

6. UI/UX Issues

Broken navigation, inconsistent layouts, missing responsive views

🧮 Output Format (Report Only)

1. Summary Table
Include:

ID	Severity	File Path	Issue Type	Description	Recommended Fix

2. Module Status Overview

Module	Status	Missing / Incomplete Parts

3. Observations
List global architectural inconsistencies, redundant code, unreferenced files, or broken workflows.

4. Next Steps (Suggestions Only)
Summarize what needs to be fixed or implemented. Do not apply any fixes.

⚙️ Execution Rules

Do not modify any files — report only

Include file paths and line numbers if possible

Assign severity levels:

P0 – Critical, breaks functionality

P1 – Major, missing required logic

P2 – Minor, code inconsistency or cleanup

P3 – Cosmetic/UI improvement

🧭 Goal

Produce a single, structured audit report showing:

What’s missing

Where it’s missing

What’s required to complete each part

This report will guide future code generation or patching confidently.

Final Instruction:

Run the scan and return a structured report (JSON + readable summary) of all missing, incomplete, or broken parts in ClassicPOS. Do not modify any code — report only.
