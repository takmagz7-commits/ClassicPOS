Prompt — “Report Only” (No Code Changes)

You are an AI software engineer reviewing the ClassicPOS project.
Your task is to scan the entire codebase — including frontend, backend, and configuration files — and produce a detailed report (no code modifications yet).

🔍 Objective

Generate a comprehensive report identifying all missing, unfinished, or broken parts of the ClassicPOS system.

🧩 Scope of Scan

Check all files and folders, including but not limited to:

src/ (components, modules, pages, hooks, utils)

api/, server/, routes/, controllers/, services/

Config files (package.json, vite.config.ts, tsconfig.json, .env.example)

Database models or schema definitions

UI layout and routing structure

🧾 Report Should Include

Unfinished or Placeholder Features

Incomplete or stubbed modules, components, or pages.

TODO, FIXME, console.log() placeholders.

Broken Links or Dependencies

Missing imports or unused variables.

Missing components, broken route references, or undefined functions.

Incomplete Business Logic

Inventory workflows (GRN, SA, TOG, valuation, reports)

Checkout and Payments (multiple payments, barcode, open orders)

CRM (customer data, leads, analytics)

Accounting (credit notes, debtors)

Settings, billing, subscriptions, and receipt configuration.

Integration Gaps

Missing API endpoints or data flow.

Offline DB sync not linked.

Authentication or session logic not completed.

Environment & Configuration Issues

Missing .env variables or misconfigured settings.

Missing dependencies in package.json.

UI/UX Issues

Inconsistent layouts, broken navigation, missing responsive views.

🧮 Output Format (Report Only)

Return the findings in this structured format:

📋 Summary Table
ID	Severity	File Path	Issue Type	Description	Recommended Fix
INV-001	P0	src/modules/inventory/ProductForm.tsx	Missing Logic	Form does not save valuation method	Add valuationMethod field to form state and API payload
📁 Module Status Overview
Module	Status	Missing / Incomplete Parts
Authentication	✅ Complete	—
Inventory	⚠️ Partial	GRN logic, valuation, reports
Checkout	❌ Incomplete	Multiple payment, open orders
CRM	⚠️ Partial	Customer analytics missing
Accounting	⚠️ Partial	Credit note flow missing
Reports	⚠️ Partial	AI analytics, export feature
Settings	⚠️ Partial	Tax setup, subscription link missing
🧠 Observations

List global architectural or structural inconsistencies.

Note redundant code, naming conflicts, or unreferenced files.

Summarize missing API connections or broken workflows.

✅ Next Steps (Suggestions Only)

Short summary of what needs to be fixed or implemented.

Do not apply fixes yet — just describe them.

⚙️ Execution Rules

Do not modify any files yet.

Only analyze and report.

Be explicit about:

File paths

Line numbers (if possible)

Severity levels:

P0 – Critical, breaks functionality

P1 – Major, missing required logic

P2 – Minor, code inconsistency or cleanup

P3 – Cosmetic/UI improvement

🧭 Goal

Produce a single, complete audit report showing:

What’s missing

Where it’s missing

What’s required to complete each part
So the next step will be to generate or patch code confidently.

Final instruction:

“Run the scan and return a structured report (JSON + readable summary) of all missing, incomplete, or broken parts in ClassicPOS. Do not modify any code — report only.”
